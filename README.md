## ✨ Key Highlights

🚀 Algorithm Visualization  
🎮 Interactive & Animated UI  
🌓 Light / Dark Mode Support  
🖥️ Fullscreen & Responsive Scaling  
🧠 Shortest Path Guaranteed

## 🛠️ Features Overview

### 🔹 Maze Generation
- Random maze generation using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with backtracking  
- Ensures every maze is **fully solvable**

### 🔹 Maze Solving
- Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- Always finds the **shortest path** from start to end

### 🔹 Interactive Visualization
- Real-time rendering of:
  - Walls
  - Start & End points
  - Solution path
- Smooth **step-by-step animation** of the solver

### 🔹 Customization Options
- 🌓 Toggle between **Light & Dark themes**
- 🖥️ Switch **Fullscreen / Windowed mode**
- 📐 Automatically adapts maze size based on screen resolution
